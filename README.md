Dynamic programming (DP) is a powerful technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful for optimization problems where the solution can be constructed from solutions to subproblems.
This repository contains examples and explanations of basic dynamic programming concepts implemented in JavaScript.
